# bad-posture-detector


Sitting in front of a laptop for long hours, I found myself spending hours hunched over my laptop, unaware of how it affected my posture.

I was experiencing the consequences of poor posture â€“ backaches, neck pain, etc. 


## Overview

This program is designed to detect deviations in a person's posture using the laptop's webcam. It leverages the Mediapipe library to analyze the pose of an individual in real-time and determine whether their posture is good or bad. It provides instant feedback to the user and keeps track of instances of bad posture.

## Features

- **Real-time Posture Analysis**: The program uses the laptop's webcam to provide real-time analysis of the user's posture.

- **Pose Landmarks**: It tracks key points on the user's body to make a comprehensive assessment of their posture.

- **Feedback**: The program instantly notifies the user whether they have good or bad posture, allowing them to make immediate corrections.

- **Bad Posture Count**: It keeps track of instances of bad posture, helping users monitor their posture improvement over time.
